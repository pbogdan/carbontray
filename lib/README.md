# libcarbontray

A from-scratch X system tray implementation using xfce4-panel and na-tray as a reference.

For more details please refer to https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop/pull/1998.

The library has been manually extracted by me (@pbogdan) from
https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop to be used standalone not depending on the desktop
environment.

All the credit for the code goes to the original author and maintainers of Budgie Desktop.

Any and all packaging bugs are my fault.
